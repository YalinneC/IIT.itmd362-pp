# Production Problem 8: Emotional Design Hunt

## The Problem

First, read the assigned reading from Donald Norman, listed on the ITMD 362 syllabus.

Then, locate a physical object that you use regularly in your life (does not have to be an electronic or digital object), take a photograph of it, and identify in a sentence or two its visceral, behavioral, and reflective levels of emotional design. Then, develop a list of three qualities in that object’s emotional design that your group might use in your MyIIT redesign project. Be sure to share these with your group.

## Deliverables

A. Photograph of the object (place in the week-13/ directory and commit).

The Image is called FullSizeRender.jpg and is a photograph of my necklace. 

B. Emotional design levels of your object:

* Visceral: This level is about appearances, this necklace is very beautiful and shiny, it is pleasant to look at it. It has details, like the Swarovski elements are in two shades of gray and very in size to cover the maximum surface.

* Behavioral: this object performs as a necklace in a very pleasant and effective way. I don’t even have to open it to put it on because my head fits with the chain is closed. Also it performs as USB stick 8GB when you detach the heart from the center, just pushing the crystal heart, no other step required. I use this as my main USB stick that I carry around. 


* Reflective:I really like this object because it is not obvious that is  USB stick and when I tell the story about this beautiful necklace being a USB stick and demonstrate it, I always receive positive comments, and when people ask me where do I got it from I also like to say that my boyfriend got it for me as a bday gift.

C.  Emotional design qualities of the object that might be useful for Project 3/MyIIT redesign:

<<<<<<< HEAD
1.Beautiful, pleasant to look at.
2.Color gradient, (like the necklace different tones of gray)
3.effectiveness, that it achieves it’s purpose in an efficient and direct way, with no unnecessary steps.
